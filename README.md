= Task Lister

A tool to take a folder on the network, wait for a group of PDFs, combine them, and then email out the new combined PDF as an attachment. 

== Configuration

This tool is still awaiting full deployment.

== Testing

This script was designed and concepted by myself, but I had input and help from a couple different people who are much, much smarter than myself. 

The reason this was created was to speed up a process that I did daily. However, the need for this script was put to rest after the documents I was working with did not need to be sent out company wide anymore. 

I still need to go through and finish up a few things and make this script fully functional.
